// what are the final values of all the variables in the code below
// let a = 1, b = 1;  // a = 2, b=2, c= 2, d= 1
// let c = ++a,
//     d = b++


// What are the values of a and x after the code below?

let a = 2;
    
let x = 1 + (a *= 2);    
// The answer is:

// a = 4 (multiplied by 2)
// x = 5 (calculated as 1 + 4)
